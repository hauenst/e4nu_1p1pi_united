# Open the ProduceOverlayPlots.cpp file and choose which plots you want to create 
# For 1D plots, add the line OverlayPlots.cpp
# For 2D plots, add the line Create2DPlots.cpp

# Then just type

root -l ProduceOverlayPlots.cpp

# Now if you open the 2 files above, just add the files that you want to use (and [if necessary/not happy with the existing ones]), change the names of the labels for the samples
